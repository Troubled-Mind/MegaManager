# MegaManager
MegaManager was created out of a desire to make file management across multiple mega accounts more simple, including refreshing the logins for accounts, auto-uploading, and more!

# Requirements
You will need to download the latest version of MegaCMD https://mega.io/cmd and put the path to this file in your settings tab of the UI.
